# HIPO UI Functionality Overview

The HIPO Streamlit UI provides a comprehensive interface for managing the multi-cloud Kubernetes ML infrastructure. Here's what users would see when using the application:

## Dashboard View

The main dashboard provides an overview of the entire system, with multiple panels showing:

1. **Cloud Infrastructure Status**:
   - AWS and GCP clusters with region information
   - Operational status (Running/Error) 
   - Key metrics: Nodes, Pods, Cost/Hour

2. **Model Deployment Status**:
   - Currently deployed models (llama2-7b, bert-base, gpt-j-6b)
   - Deployment provider (AWS/GCP)
   - Status (Running/Scaling)
   - Number of endpoints

3. **Resource Usage Metrics**:
   - Tabbed interface for CPU, Memory, GPU, and Network metrics
   - Time-series graphs showing utilization percentages
   - Historical data over configurable time periods

4. **Request Metrics**:
   - Total requests, success rate, average latency, P95 latency
   - Pie chart showing request distribution by model

5. **Cost Metrics**:
   - Today's and monthly costs
   - Bar charts showing costs by provider and by model

## Model Deployment View

This view allows users to deploy new models and manage existing ones:

1. **Model Configuration**:
   - Model selection dropdown with available models
   - Display of model type, parameters, and hardware requirements
   - Cloud provider selection (AWS, GCP, or Multi-Cloud)
   - Region selection based on provider
   - Scaling configuration with min/max replicas and target CPU utilization

2. **Deployed Models**:
   - Table of all deployed models with version, provider, and status
   - Expandable details for each model showing:
     - Performance metrics (latency, success rate, requests/min)
     - Action buttons (Restart, Scale, Delete)
   - Deployment logs showing the progress of recent deployments

## Secure Weights Management View

This specialized interface provides comprehensive management of model weights:

1. **Upload Model Weights**:
   - Model name and version input
   - Storage options with primary provider selection
   - Cross-cloud replication configuration
   - Security options (encryption, versioning, access control)
   - Checksum algorithm selection
   - Additional metadata fields
   - File upload functionality with progress tracking

2. **Model Weight Management**:
   - Browse Models tab showing all available model weights with their details
   - Version Management tab for comparing and managing different versions
   - Storage Status tab showing utilization and cost across providers
   - Security Audit tab for monitoring access and verifying integrity

## UI Components and Interactions

The UI provides rich interactive elements:

1. **Navigation**: Sidebar with main section links
2. **Data Visualization**:
   - Line charts for time-series data
   - Bar charts for comparisons
   - Pie charts for distributions
3. **Interactive Controls**:
   - Dropdown menus for selection
   - Sliders for numeric parameters
   - Checkboxes and radio buttons for options
   - File upload widgets
4. **Feedback Mechanisms**:
   - Progress bars for long-running operations
   - Success/warning/error messages
   - Detailed logs for operations
5. **Data Presentation**:
   - Metric displays for key numbers
   - Tables for detailed data
   - JSON views for structured information
   - Expandable sections for details on demand

This UI provides a comprehensive, user-friendly interface to the powerful backend functionality of the HIPO platform, allowing users to manage ML infrastructure, deploy models, and handle model weights securely across multiple cloud providers.
