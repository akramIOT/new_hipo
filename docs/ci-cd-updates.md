# CI/CD System Updates

This document outlines the recent improvements made to the CI/CD pipeline for the HIPO project.

## Updates Applied

### 1. Pre-commit Integration

Added a `.pre-commit-config.yaml` configuration file to enable local validation before committing:
- Code formatting with Black and isort
- Static analysis with flake8
- Type checking with mypy
- Security scanning with bandit
- Basic file validation (trailing whitespace, merge conflicts, etc.)

To use pre-commit locally:
```bash
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
```

### 2. Workflow Files Versioning

Updated GitHub Actions dependencies to latest versions:
- `actions/checkout@v4`
- `actions/setup-python@v5`
- `codecov/codecov-action@v4`
- `actions/upload-artifact@v4`
- `docker/setup-buildx-action@v3`
- `docker/login-action@v3`
- `docker/build-push-action@v5`

### 3. Docker Repository Configuration

Fixed Docker Hub repository references:
- Updated from placeholder `yourusername/hipo` to `akramsheriff/hipo`
- Ensured consistent image naming across all workflows

### 4. Kubernetes Namespace Consistency

Fixed namespace mismatch in deployment verification:
- Updated Kubernetes commands to target the correct `hipo` namespace
- Aligned CI/CD workflow with k8s configuration files

### 5. Missing Resources

Added required files and directories:
- Created `scripts/cleanup_test_resources.py` for automated cleanup
- Added performance test suite in `tests/performance/`
- Configured workflow synchronization to keep branches in sync

### 6. Dockerfile Security Improvements

- Updated the Google Cloud SDK installation method
- Used HTTPS for all package repositories
- Fixed deprecated `apt-key` usage
- Improved key handling for better security

### 7. Workflow Synchronization

Added a new workflow (`workflow-sync.yml`) that automatically:
- Syncs workflow files from main to develop branch
- Creates PRs for workflow updates to ensure consistency
- Prevents configuration drift between branches

## Required GitHub Secrets

The CI/CD system uses the following GitHub secrets:

| Secret Name | Purpose |
|-------------|---------|
| `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` | AWS authentication |
| `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` | AWS authentication |
| `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME` | Docker Hub publishing |
| `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN` | Docker Hub authentication |
| `CODECOV_TOKEN` | Coverage reporting |
| `PYPI_API_TOKEN` | Package publishing |
| `WORKFLOW_SYNC_TOKEN` | Workflow synchronization |
| `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` | GCP service account (JSON content) |
| `AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING` | Azure Blob Storage connection |

## Local Environment Setup

To run CI checks locally before pushing:

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

# Run linting and type checking
flake8 src/ tests/
black --check --line-length=127 src/ tests/
isort --check-only --profile black --line-length=127 src/ tests/
mypy src/

# Run tests
pytest tests/unit --cov=src
pytest tests/integration  # Requires LocalStack

# Run security checks
bandit -r src/ -c pyproject.toml
safety check -r requirements.txt -r requirements-dev.txt

# Build package
python -m build
```

## Next Steps

- [ ] Add branch protection rules to require passing CI checks
- [ ] Configure auto-deployment to staging environment
- [ ] Implement PR labeling automation for release notes
- [ ] Set up dependency scanning and vulnerability alerts
- [ ] Improve test coverage reporting and quality gates
