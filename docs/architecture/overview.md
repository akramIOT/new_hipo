# Architecture Overview

HIPO is designed with a modular architecture that supports deployment across multiple cloud providers.

## Core Components

### Cloud Providers

The platform abstracts away cloud-specific APIs through a unified provider interface, allowing seamless
deployment to AWS, GCP, and other supported cloud environments.

### Kubernetes Orchestration

HIPO uses Kubernetes as the orchestration layer for deploying and managing ML workloads. This provides:

- Container-based deployment
- Horizontal and vertical scaling
- Resource management
- Service discovery

### Model Management

The platform includes robust capabilities for:

- Secure storage of model weights
- Version control
- Access control
- Integrity verification

### Autoscaling

The autoscaling system monitors resource utilization and automatically adjusts the cluster size based on workload demands.
