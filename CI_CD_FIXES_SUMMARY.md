# CI/CD Fixes Summary

This document summarizes the changes made to fix CI/CD issues in the HIPO project.

## Files Created

1. **Pre-commit Configuration**
   - Created `.pre-commit-config.yaml` with configurations for code quality and security checks

2. **Scripts**
   - Created `scripts/cleanup_test_resources.py` for automated cleanup of cloud resources after tests
   - Created `scripts/validate_ci.sh` for local CI validation

3. **Test Files**
   - Created `tests/performance/test_model_performance.py` with benchmark tests

4. **Documentation**
   - Created `docs/ci-cd-updates.md` documenting CI/CD improvements
   - Created `CI_CD_FIXES_SUMMARY.md` (this file) summarizing all changes

5. **Workflow Files**

## Files Updated

1. **CI Workflows**
   - Updated Docker Hub repository names from placeholder to `akramsheriff/hipo`
   - Fixed namespace references in Kubernetes commands from `default` to `hipo`
   - Updated GitHub Actions to latest versions:
     - `actions/checkout@v3` → `actions/checkout@v4`
     - `actions/setup-python@v4` → `actions/setup-python@v5`
     - `actions/upload-artifact@v3` → `actions/upload-artifact@v4`
     - `codecov/codecov-action@v3` → `codecov/codecov-action@v4`

2. **Dockerfile**

   - Replaced deprecated `apt-key` command with secure key handling
   - Updated HTTP to HTTPS for package repositories

3. **README.md**
   - Added information about CI/CD updates
   - Added instructions for local CI validation

## Security Improvements

1. **Dockerfile Security**
   - Fixed deprecated key handling
   - Used HTTPS instead of HTTP for package sources
   - Implemented proper key permissions

2. **Pre-commit Integration**
   - Added security scanning with bandit
   - Added checks for private keys and merge conflicts
   - Added code quality checks for consistent style

3. **Workflow Security**
   - Added workflow for synchronizing CI/CD configurations
   - Added documentation for required secrets

## Next Steps

The following items remain to be addressed:

1. **GitHub Secrets Setup**
   - The workflows require several secrets to be configured
   - Documentation is available in `docs/github-secrets-setup.md`

2. **Environment-Specific Configuration**
   - Kubernetes configurations may need environment-specific adjustments
   - Review and update environment variables in deployment files

3. **Complete CI/CD Pipeline Testing**
   - The pipeline should be tested end-to-end
   - Consider implementing canary deployments for production releases
